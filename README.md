This Project is based on social media link prediction whether two users are going to be friend in future or not.

OverView:
An introduction to link prediction, how it works, and where you can use it in the real-world
Learn about the importance of Link Prediction on social media
Build your first Link Prediction model for a Facebook use case using Python

In order to optimize link prediction of from social media network with the help of the dataset, we will have to take the following steps:

* Download the dataset from the https://networkrepository.com/fb-pages-food.php.
* Import data from dataset and perform initial high-level analysis:
    look at the number of rows,look at the missing values, look at dataset columns and their values respective to the prediction outcome.
* Clean the data: remove irrelevant columns, deal with missing and incorrect values if present in dataset
* Preprocessing
* Train Test Split 
* Use machine learning techniques to predict future friend outcome and to find out factors, which affect the success of the prediction.
